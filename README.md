# Full Stack Web Application

This repository contains both the frontend and backend of my full stack project.  
The **frontend** is built using React.js, and the **backend** uses Node.js with Express.js.  

Both folders are organized inside a single repository for easy development.  
To start the frontend: go to `/Todo_App` → run `npm install` → `npm run dev`.  
To start the backend: go to `/Todo_App_Backend` → run `npm install` → `npm run dev`.  
Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`, backend runs at `http://localhost:5000`.  
This project includes API integration, CRUD operations, and responsive UI.  
Developed by **Vignesh**.
